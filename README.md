# My Neovim set-up

A direct copy of my `~/.config/nvim` directory. Things may require
external tools (like Intelephense) to be installed.

If I remember to push all changes, this config works with the latest
version in the [Debian Sid repository](https://packages.debian.org/sid/neovim).

Feel free to take bits and pieces from this repository, most of it is
taken from others anyways.
