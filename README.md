# My Neovim set-up

A direct copy of my `~/.config/nvim` directory. Things may require external
tools (like phpactor) to be installed. Copy the `lua/vars.lua.dist` file to
`lua/vars.lua` and point the settings to the correct programs.

If I remember to push all changes, this config works with the latest Neovim
version in the [Debian Sid repository](https://packages.debian.org/sid/neovim).

Feel free to take bits and pieces from this repository, most of it is taken
from others anyways.
